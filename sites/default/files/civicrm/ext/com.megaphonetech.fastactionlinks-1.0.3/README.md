# Fast Action Links extension for CiviCRM

Speed up your CiviCRM workflows by adding custom action links to your search results.

With a single click, you can execute one or more actions on a contact.  For instance, add a contact to Group A, remove them from Group B, send an email explaining the change, etc.

Documentation is available here: https://docs.civicrm.org/fastactionlinks/en/latest

### Credits
This extension is a project I did with about 70 hours of my own time - no one paid me for this work!  If you benefit from this extension, please consider:
* Hiring me for work!
* spending some time engaging in the CiviCRM community.  Attend a meetup, go to CiviCon, answer some new user's question on Stack Exchange.  Thanks!
